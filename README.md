# Branching and Pull Requests

For safety's concern, changes will not be made to the Team Caffeine repo until
a pull request from a child repo branch (e.g. `feature/feature-name`) has been
issued and that code has passed all tests.

To issue a change to the Team Caffeine project repository:

  1. Fork this repository for your own account.
  2. If you've already forked this repository, [synchronize your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)'s `master` branch with Team Caffeine's.
  2. Make the branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/feature-name`).
  3. Make your changes and run tests.
  4. Run `gradle build`. Your code is ready for a PR when (and only when) it passes.
  5. Diff, Add, and Commit your files as necessary, then push to your forked repo.
  6. On the GitHub website, create a PR.
  7. Other team members will review and comment on the code.
  8. Once the code is validated _and_ verified, [@jwarner112](http://www.github.com/jwarner112) will merge into the Project's `master` branch.
